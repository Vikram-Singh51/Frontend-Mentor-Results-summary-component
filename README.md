# Frontend-Mentor-Results-summary-component
During this project creating box and and then making circle out of the square was easy for me. But placing number and text was bit tricky. but luckily I was able to solve that problem with only little efforts.

Overall Project for me good and I learn that:-
display: flex;
justify-content: center; 
these property we have to apply on parent div to get result for child div. 
I learn how to apply linear gradient.
